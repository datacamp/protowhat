def has_command(state, pattern, msg, fixed=False, commands=None):
    r"""Test whether the bash history has a command matching the pattern

    Args:
        state: State instance describing student and solution code. Can be omitted if used with Ex().
        pattern: text that command must contain (can be a regex pattern or a simple string)
        msg: feedback message if no matching command is found
        fixed: whether to match text exactly, rather than using regular expressions
        commands: the bash history commands to check against.
            By default this will be all commands since the last bash history info update.
            Otherwise pass a list of commands to search through, created by calling the helper function
            ``get_bash_history()``.

    Note:
        The helper function ``update_bash_history_info(bash_history_path=None)``
        needs to be called in the pre-exercise code in exercise types that don't have
        built-in support for bash history features.

    Note:
        If the bash history info is updated every time code is submitted
        (by using ``update_bash_history_info()`` in the pre-exercise code),
        it's advised to only use this function as the second part of a ``check_correct()``
        to help students debug the command they haven't correctly run yet.
        Look at the examples to see what could go wrong.

        If bash history info is only updated at the start of an exercise,
        this can be used everywhere as the (cumulative) commands from all submissions are known.

    :Example:

        The goal of an exercise is to use ``man``.

        If the exercise doesn't have built-in support for bash history SCTs,
        update the bash history info in the pre-exercise code::

            update_bash_history_info()

        In the SCT, check whether a command with ``man`` was used::

            Ex().has_command("$man\s", "Your command should start with ``man ...``.")

    :Example:

        The goal of an exercise is to use ``touch`` to create two files.

        In the pre-exercise code, put::

            update_bash_history_info()

        This SCT can cause problems::

            Ex().has_command("touch.*file1", "Use `touch` to create `file1`")
            Ex().has_command("touch.*file2", "Use `touch` to create `file2`")

        If a student submits after running ``touch file0 && touch file1`` in the console,
        they will get feedback to create ``file2``.
        If they submit again after running ``touch file2`` in the console,
        they will get feedback to create ``file1``, since the SCT only has access
        to commands after the last bash history info update (only the second command in this case).
        Only if they execute all required commands in a single submission the SCT will pass.

        A better SCT in this situation checks the outcome first
        and checks the command to help the student achieve it::

            Ex().check_correct(
                check_file('file1', parse=False),
                has_command("touch.*file1", "Use `touch` to create `file1`")
            )
            Ex().check_correct(
                check_file('file2', parse=False),
                has_command("touch.*file2", "Use `touch` to create `file2`")
            )

# Other SCTs using bash history as the code?

## Option 1

use existing functionality
- ugly code using internals
- only 'multi': all commands need to pass SCT

```py
commands = get_bash_history()
for command in commands:
    Ex(Ex()._state.to_child(student_code=command)).has_code()
```

## Option 2

new general (dangerous?) ``update`` SCT to override arbitrary State attributes
alternative: update `override()` SCT with optional `student_code` argument (safer)

```py
def update(state, **kwargs):
    return state.to_child(**kwargs)
```

### Use cases:

- equivalent of `Ex().has_command(commands, pattern)`:
```py
Ex().check_or(*[update(student_code=command).has_code(pattern) for command in commands])
```


- shellwhat parsing of bash history:
```py
Ex().check_or(
    *[
        update(student_code=command)
        .check_node(node_name)
        .check_edge(edge_name)
        .has_equal_ast()
        for command in commands
    ]
